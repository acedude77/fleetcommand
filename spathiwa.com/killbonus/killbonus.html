	<h4>Kill bonus </h4>
	
	<p>As we have already slightly covered, the kill bonus, indicated in the orange 
	circle, represents a damage bonus in percentage. It is calculated by the following formula:</p>
	
	<p align="left"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Kill 
	Bonus = Kills / (Kills+4) * 50<br>

	ex.: You have 3 kills - KB = 3 / (3+4) * 50 = 21.4285 = 21 (rounded to nearest whole number)</font></p>



<script type="text/javascript">

function test1(){
 var bonus;
 var kills=document.getElementById("kills").value * 1;
 bonus=kills/(kills+4)*50;
 document.getElementById("kb").value=Math.round(bonus);
}

function test2(){
 var kills;
 var kb=document.getElementById("kb").value * 1;
 kills=(4 * kb) / (50 - kb);
 document.getElementById("kills").value=Math.round(kills);
}

</script>

<h4>KB Calculator</h4>
<input type="text" id="kills" onchange="test1()"> consecutive kill(s) =  <input type="text" id="kb" onchange="test2()"> KB<br>
<br>

	<p>A 10% kb will result in a 10% damage bonus. As you destroy more ships, 
	the kill bonus slowly rises toward a maximum of 50 (396 kills). The 
	kb cannot get any higher than 50 because it is a mathematical impossibility 
	with the formula. Note that killing eject pods does not increase your 
	kill bonus. Your kills bonus will apply to every weapon, missile and 
	piece of equipment that can inflict damage.</p>
	
	<p>When a pod is destroyed, the pilot dies and so does the kill bonus, which 
	is reset to 0. This is why even though a pilot has 100 kills, s/he can 
	still have a 0 kb. The kb is only higher with the number of <b>consecutive</b> 
	kills, without the pilot dying. Note that getting podded has no effect 
	on your kill bonus, you won't lose anything, but get yourself rescued 
	or you might lose it.</p>
