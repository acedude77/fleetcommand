So far this is being developed for the single user in mind primarily. I'd like this tool to be used by multiple users in the end so I have to start thinking about how users can create their own accounts, save their submitted data in their own tables, be able to retrieve their data at any later time.

I guess I can base their accounts on their submitted email addresses but making all the changes to the existing code to accommodate a multi-user environment will take time / energy from getting the program to generate something more tangibly useful for the average user.

I'll postpone this portion of the project until the very end but I'll try to keep this in mind so my design decisions doesn't take me too far off the wrong path.
