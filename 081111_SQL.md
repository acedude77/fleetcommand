Need to come up with some interesting SQL queries, preferably addressing some statistics that are not already covered on the Leaderboard.

Here are some preliminary possibilities:
(can't guarantee all of these are feasible, interesting or even useful)

  1. Check the propensity of Player X to play with or fly under the command of Player Y.
  1. Display the typical playing hours of Player X.
  1. More accurate display of one's performance improvement over time by tallying results according to gametype, game size, maybe even by time of day.
  1. Percentage of times Player X places among the top 10 on ending scores.
