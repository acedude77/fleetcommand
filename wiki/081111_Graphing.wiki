Graphing is the visual output after we can come up with some interesting sql queries to our growing database. The actual graphing isn't a big issue, I've got some experience using Chart::Strip, the challenge is coming up with some statistical analyses that are relevant to users.

Possibly can enlist the help of the community to tell me what they would like to see. The current vision of the end result is some sort of one-page personal report card.
