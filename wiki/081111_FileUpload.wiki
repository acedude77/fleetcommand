I'm stealing some code to get a basic file uploading cgi form / uploader done. No point in reinventing the wheel. I should probably rename the uploaded file according to their email account so that multiple users can upload at once and not overwrite each other's data.

The idea is to avoid inadvertent DoS on my server by processing the uploaded files at my own schedule rather than processing them "on demand". I should request their email on their submission forms so that I can alert them when their submission has been processed and ready for viewing too.

One way to accomplish this is to store all the uploaded files into some directory, say /tmp/uploads. Then I can run a cron job to check this directory for any files and process them if there are any. Once processed, I can move the files to another directory and send the email to give the user a URL to pick up the results.
