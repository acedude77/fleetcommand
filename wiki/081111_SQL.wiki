Need to come up with some interesting SQL queries, preferably addressing some statistics that are not already covered on the Leaderboard.

Here are some preliminary possibilities:
(can't guarantee all of these are feasible, interesting or even useful)

  # Check the propensity of Player X to play with or fly under the command of Player Y.
  # Display the typical playing hours of Player X.
  # More accurate display of one's performance improvement over time by tallying results according to gametype, game size, maybe even by time of day.
  # Percentage of times Player X places among the top 10 on ending scores.
